        <p> Title: Masked
Semester/Year: Year 1
Software: Illustrator
Description: I chose these colors because these are the colors that I wear the most and represent with. The mask
that I’m wearing represents a lot of what I hide in front of others. I even chose the most neutral appearance I
have for the sake of looking “in between”.</p>

Title: The Rainbow effect
Semester/Year:1
Software, coding/programming languages: firealpaca , photoshop, iMovie audacity
Description 
The message of this piece is quite simple. I want to bring attention to sexual preference and gender identity. This topic is very important and those who part of this community are always fighting to be seen as a human being and not some form of monster or abnormality. I chose a more comedic route than the normal argumentative route. I drew every frame ad voiced it myself.

Description: I chose these pictures because they represent my love for gaming, computers and even my
preferred pronouns and gender identity which is in the bottom right corner of the selfie. It was the best way to
show how everyone how I represent myself. I even added the glitch filter onto it.</p>

Audio : Portrait of a Place

My work goes through the storyline of a stressed man running through the rain and goes into a bar to unwind. I wanted the sounds to pan over in the headsets and really get the reader to listen in. I used many sounds to accomplish this
